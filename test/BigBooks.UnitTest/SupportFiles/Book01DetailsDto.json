  "Description": "A departing tortoise has his bags packed and is almost ready to set out on an adventure, but he cannot leave until he says good-bye to each of his animal friends. The tortoise stops for every last timid mouse and bumblebee, shouting his rhyming good-byes, making you wonder if, perhaps, he’s stalling the start of his trip.",
